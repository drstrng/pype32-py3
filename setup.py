# Distutils hack: in order to be able to build MSI installers with loose
# version numbers, we subclass StrictVersion to accept loose version numbers
# and convert them to the strict format. This works because Distutils will
# happily reinstall a package even if the version number matches exactly the
# one already installed on the system - so we can simply strip all extraneous
# characters and beta/postrelease version numbers will be treated just like
# the base version number.
